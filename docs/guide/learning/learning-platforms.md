# Learning platforms

## Vue specific
A Vue specific learning platform is one that is solely focused on getting you up and running with Vue.js and its surrounding ecosystem. 

These will focus on building Vue applications, best practices in the real world and usually go deeper into the framework.

### Vue Mastery
[Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/) is a specialized Vue learning platform, hosted by Gregg Pollack and Adam Jahr. Both of them are veterans, with years of experience at teaching.

Courses range from absolute beginner to intermediate and advanced ones, some of which can be viewed for free. Each lesson includes both video and written article style format, with lots of visual examples. Video and related source code can be easily downloaded for offline use.

They also host Vue.js conference videos and co-organize and record the weekly Vue newsletter podcast.

### Vue School
[Vue School](https://vueschool.io/) is a platform that focuses a bit more on intermediate to advanced Vue users. Their courses cover a wide range of topics, like component testing, nuxt, vuex, form validation, with both free and paid version, where the paid account can unlock further content on some courses.

Lessons are developed by core team members Alex Kyriakidis, Chris Fritz and experts like Rolf Haug, Roman Kuba, Chopin brothers (nuxt.js authors) and many more.

## General Development
The platforms listed below cover wider range of topics, with some more specialized than others. 

All of them have Vue courses, among other things, that are definitely worth checking out.

### Laracast
[Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/) is an online learning platform targeted mainly towards Laravel developers. Their Vue courses are nice, with extra smaller videos mixed into other lessons, like the "Let's Build A Forum with Laravel and TDD" one, which shows how they used Vue.js to build components for their own Laracasts forum.

The videos explain in detail real world examples, reusable patterns, no generic todo apps or shop pages. For Laravel developers who like to tinker with Vue, the platform is a really good investment, as it covers both.

The instructor and author of the platform, Jeffrey Way, is a pro when it comes to teaching. He has years of experience behind his back, and the quality of the videos is very good.
