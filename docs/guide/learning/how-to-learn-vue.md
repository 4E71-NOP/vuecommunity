# How to learn Vue
As with any technology, its best to start with the official documentation, in this case the [Vue.js Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/). The guide is a magnificent, constantly updated learning resource, which does a superb job at giving a good starting point, needed to build an application with Vue. From basic reactivity concepts and caveats, to more advanced use cases, it should be the first place to learn from.

Checkout the [Official Documentation](./official-documentation.md) page on this website, to learn more about the official Vue learning resources. 

If you are a tutorial or course learner, go over the [Courses](./courses.md) and [Learning Platforms](./learning-platforms.md) pages, where we go over the best premium and free resources to learn from. If you prefer books, then the [Books](./books.md) page might be a better match.

If you want to find out how other people learn, the [Tips from Mentors](./tips-from-mentors.md) page gives a good insight into how Vue experts have started with Vue.

## Categorizing applications by technology
When beginning to develop with Vue.js, it helps to know what kind of application you will be building. This will help you outline the kind of technologies you will need to master in order to start building apps with Vue.

In this section, we will go over the categories under which most Vue powered websites fall under and what tech they require.

### SPA Websites

-- General tech needed to build those. Links to some pages from here + some tuts

### Static Websites

-- Short introduction, why those make sense, links to such frameworks and tuts

### Vue enhanced websites

-- Explain what these are, when it makes sense for those and most common use cases.
Links to tutorials, etc.

## Coming from other technology
-- this section is meant to help people coming from other technology backgrounds to get up and running faster with Vue.
It should explain how those either compare or can be implemented with Vue.
