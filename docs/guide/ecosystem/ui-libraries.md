# UI libraries

No matter how many times people ask us about it, the answer won't change. There really is no such a thing as "the best" UI library for Vue. But you can find one that may be optimal to your use case.

Most of them fall into one of four groups:

## Material Deseign

Material Design based libraries like Vuetify or Vue-Material follow the design concept created by Google for Android mobile applications. The components look fancy and have a mobile feel, but since they were written with a certain design style in mind, they're not fully customizable.

### Vuetify

### Vue-Material

## Ant Design

Element UI, iView and other Ant Design based libraries are kind of opposite. They're meant to be used primaly on desktop, so the mobile and responsive design support is scarce for them. The reason? AntD is targetted at Chinese web market, where traditional websites aren't usually used on the phones. Such libraries often provide separate mobile solution, like Mint UI in case of Element.

### Element UI

### iView

## Components for CSS Frameworks

Third group of UI libraries are those that provide sets of components for traditional CSS frameworks. Both those which originally contain Javascript features, such as Bootstrap, Semantic UI or UIKit, and the purely CSS ones like Bulma. It's a good option of you're looking for some specific design style or are already familiar with the CSS framework, maybe even want to rewrite an already existing application using one of them.

### Bootstrap-Vue

### Buefy

### Vuikit

### Semantic UI Whatever

## Other UI libraries

### Fish UI
