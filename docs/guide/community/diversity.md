# Diversity

The concepts of diversity play an important role in Vue.js community and will continue to play it in the future. There still can be done a lot though to make it more inclusive for the people from underrepresented groups.

Most of the related actions are the bottom up initiatives. A good example are the discounted or free tickets to conferences, provided thanks to the organizers and sponsors of events such as Vue Amsterdam, VueConfUS, Vue London or VueConfTO.

A lot of good work is also done by individual developers, speakers and article writers among females or people of color, as well as other minorities in the web development world, who blaze the trails for their peers, making it easier for them to get more active too.

## Vue Vixens

Vue Vixens is an organization of female developers who try to close the gap between the representation of men and women in Vue.js ecosystem. Their main way of activity is providing free workshops during tech conferences and meetups around the world. 

If you identify as a woman, you're invited to take part in their events, called skulks. The content of workshops is beginner level, usually the basics of Vue.js and writing a simple mobile application with Nativescript-Vue.

Depending on the available time, they are either:
- full day workshops based on more individual work with mentors
- mini workshops with attendees following the instructions of the skulk leader

The community is managed by three awesome ladies. [Jen Looper](https://twitter.com/jenlooper) is the main leader of Vue Vixens, [Natalia Tepluhina](https://twitter.com/N_Tepluhina) is responsible for the workshops content as well as the website, while [Diana Rodriguez](https://twitter.com/cotufa82) is a worldwide community organizer, taking care of the group of so called chapter leaders, who are the representatives for particular countries. 

Vue Vixens have also allies among men, who are invited to join the events as mentors.

You can get more details on the progress of their programme in the [2018 Retrospective and 2019 Roadmap](https://dev.to/vuevixens/2018-vue-vixens-retrospective-and-2019-roadmap-19ei) blog article.

Other than the workshops, Vue Vixens serve as a kind of female voice representative in the community and they happily share their connections, knowledge and resources. If you want to reach out to Vue Vixens or get to know other female developers in the community, feel free to join their Slack server.

## Concatenate Conference

We direct special thanks to [Christian Nwamba](https://twitter.com/codebeast), known for his popular Vue.js course, and the Core Team member [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo), coorganizers of Concatenate. 

It's a free webdev conference in Lagos, Nigeria, with top tier speakers from around the world, that come to Africa to network and share their knowledge with those who often find it difficult to attend the tech conferences on other continents. 

Having people from Vue.js community take part in organizing such an undertaking both makes us proud and gives a lot of much needed hope.
