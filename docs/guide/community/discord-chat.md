# Discord chat

## Welcome to VueLand

## Rooms

One of the reasons we switched from Gitter to Discord was to gain the ability to use multiple rooms on the chat. Some say we've got too many of them, some others would want a few additional ones and it's difficult to satisfy everyone, but we ultimately managed to achieve some compromise.

Still, newcomers may be a bit overwhelmed. So here's a short guide to most important places:

**#need-help** - you can ask for help with your code either here or on specific channels such as #vue-testing or #

**#general** - that's where most of discussions around Vue take place. If you want to get to know something about Vue or state an opinion on related topics, you're in a good spot.

**#awesome** - named after Awesome Vue repository, is the channel where we put cool links to anything we find worthy. You can find here tutorials, new libraries and even interesting tweets.

**#i-made-this** - 

**#ideas** -



## Other Vue-related servers

VueLand is not the only Vue-related server on Discord. Here's the list of other commonly used servers by Vue community.

## Why not Stack Overflow?

There's a case against chat communities, raised by some developers in the Javascript ecosystem and we're often asked this. Why not use Stack Overflow or a similar platform that will allow all the questions and answers to be easily googlable. And from the productivity point of view, this is a good question.
