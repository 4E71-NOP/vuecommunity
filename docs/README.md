# Introduction
VueCommunity is a beginners guide to official Vue projects, boilerplates, tools, courses and more.

Opposed to the [Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) or the [cookbook](https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/), where they go deeper into each topic with examples and explanations, VueCommunity collects all of the larger, popular projects and resources, classifies them by category and gives a meaningful summary, letting users easily compare and see the available options.

Its main goal is to answer common questions among new Vue.js developers, most of which are not obvious and require hands on experience with the technology.

Information is split into several sections, each outlining key parts in the ecosystem, with links to docs, tutorials and other learning resources.

## Welcome to Vue
Here you will find information about the various Vue communities, conferences, the current job market and more.

## Learning
This section dives deeper into the many possible ways to learn Vue.js, like official docs, popular blogs, books, courses, podcasts and other.

## Framework Ecosystem
In Framework Ecosystem we give a bit more information about popular Vue projects like Nuxt, Vuetify, Vuepress and others. You will find answers to popular questions like
why should you chose one framework over the other, what is the purpose of each and so on.
